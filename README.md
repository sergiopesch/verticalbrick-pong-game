## Overview
Vertical Brick Pong is a modern twist on the classic Pong and Breakout games. Control a paddle to bounce a pulsing ball and break colorful bricks arranged in a grid. Designed with a retro arcade aesthetic, this game is fully responsive and playable on both desktop and mobile devices, including iPhones.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to any screen size, from large desktops to small mobile devices.
- **Touch Controls**: Swipe on mobile screens to move the paddle, with keyboard support (arrow keys) for desktop.
- **Dynamic Grid**: Brick layout adjusts based on screen size for consistent gameplay.
- **Arcade Style**: Neon glow effects, vibrant colors, and a pixelated font (`Press Start 2P`).
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Levels increase brick rows and ball speed as you clear the grid.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Click or tap the "Start" button.
2. **Move the Paddle**:
   - **Desktop**: Use the left and right arrow keys.
   - **Mobile**: Swipe left or right on the canvas.
3. **Break Bricks**: Bounce the ball off the paddle to hit and destroy bricks (10 points each).
4. **Level Up**: Clear all bricks to advance; the grid grows, and the ball speeds up.
5. **Game Over**: If the ball falls below the paddle, the game ends. Click "Play Again" to restart.
6. **Pause**: Click "Stop" to pause the game at any time.
